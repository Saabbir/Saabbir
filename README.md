**Hi there 👋**

I'm an Optimizely-certified CRO (A/B testing) developer and veteran frontend engineer <br /> with a passion for writing high-quality code and delivering bug-free tests.

I bring 8 years of experience building high-quality, performant websites and apps <br /> using modern tools like React and Shopify.

In the past 3 years, I've specialized in CRO and A/B testing, helping e-commerce sites <br /> overcome user friction and drive revenue growth through targeted optimization. <br /> 

My code adapts beautifully across devices, ensuring flawless user experiences.

✔️ Frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) <br />
✔️ A/B testing and CRO strategy (Optimizely, AB Tasty, Convert, VWO, etc.) <br />
✔️ Shopify development <br />
